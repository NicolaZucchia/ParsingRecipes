This repository contains the code and the textual files for a project where parsing and LLMS arre applied to recipes in order to extract ingredients and cooking step.

Recipes are taken from other sources and vary in the format and style of preparation. All credit is given to the authors.

Parsing scripts:
- parser1: this version of parsing is really basic
- parser_identifiers: this version uses identifiers to detect ingredients in the text, which is especially useful whenever the recipe is a continuous text and is not well-structured

More scripts and recipes will follow.
